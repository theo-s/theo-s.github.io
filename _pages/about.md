I am currently a PhD student in the department of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Bin Yu and Jasjeet Sekhon. 
My research focuses on statistical machine learning, with recent projects developing interpretability methods for machine learning models, developing methodology for applying machine learning to causal inference, and theoretical analysis of decision trees and their ensembles. 
My application areas of interest include medicine and the social sciences and I have developed and maintain several software packages for tree-based machine learning models, causal inference, and interpreting machine learning models.
